# Hi, I’m Tristan 👋

📍 **Auckland ↔ Europe** | 🤖 **Product & Design. All in on AI.** 

> Vibe-coding PM/Designer. Experienced Product Manager, Design Lead, and Software Engineer. 15+ years of architecting, designing, building, leading and launching apps for startups and corporates. Currently focused on Applied AI.

Previously, I led product teams at Tradify, Adherium, Bloomberg, and 12080.AI, and helped conceptualise, design and build products for Isobar, Kotahi, Mitey, AJ Hackett, News International, and AKQA among others.
